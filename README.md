# hey, what's up.

- self-taught, self-proclaimed systems engineer (*really* likes writing CLIs for *fun*, apparently)
  - born and raised in the DR (WOOOOOOOOOOOO)
- programming language enthusiast (hasn't been seen settling down on a single language at all lately)
  - as an aside, interested in ***COMPUTATION ITSELF*** (functional programming) by way of Lisp-dialects-a-lot (I also like OCaml)
  - basically, interested on whatever "computation" means this week
  - well, no, generally interested in everything (are there any articles remotely related to audio-related DSP???)
- [hosting a website on GH Pages](https://thacuber2a03.github.io) (imagine buying a proper domain)
