### hey, what's up.

- self-taught, self-proclaimed systems engineer (*really* likes writing CLIs, apparently) from the DR (WOOOOOOOOOOOO)
- programming language enthusiast (hasn't been seen settling down on a single language at all lately)
  - as an aside, interested in ***COMPUTATION ITSELF*** (functional programming) by way of Lisp-dialects-a-lot (I also like OCaml)
- [hosting a website on GH Pages](https://thacuber2a03.github.io) (imagine buying a proper domain)
